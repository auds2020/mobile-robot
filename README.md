Mobile Robot code for 2.12 (Intro to Robotics). 

This is the code we created for mobile robot team for 2.12 (Intro to Robotics) at MIT. 
The mobile robot is tasked with navigating to pick up a red AED and bring it to a patient experiencing cardiac arrest, while avoiding cones in its way.

We use a combination of HSV filtering, dead reckoning, and April tag detection to help us navigate the course.
